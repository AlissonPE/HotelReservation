# HotelReservation
Develop an API to book a hotel room. We assume the hotel has only one room available.To give a chance to everyone to book the room, the stay can’t be longer than 3 days and can’t be reserved more than 30 days in advance. All reservations start at least the next day of booking. A “DAY’ in the hotel room starts from 00:00 to 23:59:59. The API is insecure.
